# CSCI-2270-Data-Structures
A repository full of my work from Intro to Computing, CSCI 1300 at CU Boulder. Fall 2017.

DISCLAIMER: Please do not use work in dishonest way! This serves as a place to show the work I have completed in the past.

Special Mentions:
Final project consisted of making a binary heap and priority queue to store data!
